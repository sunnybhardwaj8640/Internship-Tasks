Task 1: File System Simulation

I developed a console-based file system simulator that includes:
File creation
Reading file content
Deleting files
Error handling
Menu-driven UI
This task strengthened my understanding of file handling, modular coding, and user-driven programs.

🔹 Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
I built a fully functional two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with:
3×3 grid
Player turn switching (X/O)
Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
Draw handling
Input validation
This enhanced my logic-building, array handling, and clean coding practices.
